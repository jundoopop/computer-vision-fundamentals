# Welcome!

This is a repository for practising Open CV Python, 
which is regarded as an extension of the former repository [`opencv-training`](https://github.com/jundoopop/opencv-training)

Instead of manually implementing a function of Open CV, 
this project is for more practical learning of OpenCV development.

Applying or utilising the computer vision field in working or researching requires a lot of mathematical and computer knowledge.

So this repository is the first step in enhancing my computer vision skills and ability.


## Mini Projects

#### Watch what Londoners are doing through the CCTV [Directory](https://github.com/jundoopop/computer-vision-fundamentals/tree/main/get-cctv-live-from-rtsp)
